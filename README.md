# testdocument
xml stuff and plugin code of my bachelor thesis (german)


this respository includes the xml stuff needed to implement the new workitem type "testdocument" for polarion.
additionally some scripts for the fmc-extension were written and a own plugin on the basis of an polarion-example was implemented.

my latex files are stored here aswell.
it was a big mistake to write the thesis in german language.
