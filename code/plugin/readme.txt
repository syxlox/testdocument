the plugin was created on the basis of a already existing example, called "CurrentUserWorkloadServlet", from some polarion developer.
the original code is not in this folder, due to copyright.
the original code and a pdf file with instructions is in every polarion installation directory available.
if u want, u can get a test version of polarion to look up this stuff (https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/store/de-de/trial/polarion-alm-download.html).

i just changed the functionalities inside the @override doGet() function.
i, as a beginner, tried to understand as best as possible what has been done inside the examplecode and work with it as a basis.

sadly the import does not work how it is described.
