the plugin was created on the basis of a already existing example, called "CurrentUserWorkloadServlet", from some polarion developer.
the original code is in this folder aswell.

i just changed the functionalities inside the @override function.
i, as a beginner, tried to understand as best as possible what has been done inside the examplecode and work with it as a basis.
the pdf inside this folder describes how to import this plugin and how to modify it.
sadly the import does not work how it is described.
